//

//	Ce = packages this package imports, per scope     (efferent)
//	Instability = Ce / (Ca + Ce)
//
// Duplicate and self-dependencies are ignored by the caller. An isolated
// package (Ca + Ce == 0) is defined as maximally stable: instability 0,
// with the convention noted in the result's Reason.
